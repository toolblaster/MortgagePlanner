                            <p>Before you talk to a lender, you need to know your financial report card. Your credit score is a 3-digit number that tells lenders how reliable you are with debt.

                                <li><strong>Action:</strong> Get your free credit report, check it for errors, and work on paying down credit card balances to boost your score.</li>
