The <strong class="font-bold">20% down payment</strong> is the "golden rule" of home buying, but let's be honest: for many <strong class="font-bold">first-time home buyers</strong>, saving that much cash can feel like an impossible hurdle. The good news? It's not your only option. This guide will break down the pros and cons of putting down 20% versus a smaller amount, like 3-5%, and help you decide what's right for you.</p>
