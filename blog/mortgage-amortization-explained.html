                        <p>When you make your mortgage payment each month, it can feel like you're just sending money into a black hole. For the first few years, it barely seems like your loan balance goes down. This isn't a trick; it's by design, and the concept behind it is called <strong class="font-bold">mortgage amortization</strong>. Understanding this one simple idea is the most powerful tool you have for saving thousands of dollars and paying off your home faster.</p>

                            <p>Every single payment you make is divided into two parts:</p>
                            <ul class="space-y-2 mt-3 list-none pl-2 text-sm text-gray-800">

                            <p>This is the part that surprises most homeowners. Your loan is <strong class="font-bold">front-loaded with interest</strong>. Why? Because the interest is calculated based on your remaining balance. In the beginning, your balance is huge, so the interest is too.</p>
                            <p>Let's use a <strong class="font-bold">$350,000 loan</strong> at a <strong class="font-bold">6.5% interest rate</strong> for 30 years. Your fixed monthly payment for principal and interest (P&I) would be <strong class="font-bold">$2,212</strong>.</p>

                            <p>For every loan, there is a magic moment called the "tipping point."

                            <p>The chart below shows this perfectly. You can see the interest (red line) starting high and slowly declining, while the principal (green line) starts low and grows. The "X" where they cross is your tipping point.</p>

                            <p>So, how do you beat this system? You make extra principal payments. Any dollar you pay *in addition* to your regular payment goes 100% to your principal. This not only reduces your balance but also reduces the amount of interest you'll be charged next month, and every month after. This is the key to paying off your mortgage early.</p>

                                            <p>The best way is to make extra payments. This can be done by making bi-weekly payments (which adds up to one extra payment per year), adding a little extra to your monthly payment, or making one-time lump sum payments. Any extra payment designated for 'principal only' reduces your loan balance, which reduces the total interest you'll pay.</p>

                                            <p>An amortization schedule is a table that shows the breakdown of every single payment over the life of your loan. It lists how much of each payment goes to principal, how much goes to interest, and what your remaining loan balance will be after the payment is made.</p>
