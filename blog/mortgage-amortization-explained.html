A 15-year mortgage has higher monthly payments, but you build equity much faster because a larger portion of each payment goes to the principal from the very beginning.

It will also change if you refinance your loan into a new one, which creates a brand new amortization schedule.

                        <p>You make your mortgage payment every month like clockwork, but have you ever stopped to think about what's happening behind the scenes? A large portion of that payment isn't actually reducing your loan; it's going straight to interest. Understanding this process, known as <strong class="font-bold">amortization</strong>, is the key to mastering your mortgage and building equity faster. This guide will break down the concept and show you how to take control of your <strong class="font-bold">loan payoff</strong> timeline.</p>

                            <p>Understanding amortization reveals a powerful secret: small extra payments made to your principal can have a massive impact. Because these payments bypass the interest calculation for that month and directly reduce the loan balance, they save you future interest and shorten your loan term dramatically.</p>

It will also change if you refinance your loan into a new one, which creates a brand new amortization schedule. Finally, making extra principal payments will alter your schedule, causing you to pay off the loan sooner.</p>
