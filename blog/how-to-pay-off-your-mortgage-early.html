                            <h2 class="!mt-0">Why Paying Off Your Mortgage Early Makes Sense</h2>
                            <p>When you take out a mortgage, you're not just paying back the loan; you're paying interest on that loan for up to 30 years. The longer the term, the more interest you pay. For example, a $400,000 loan at 6.5% can cost over $500,000 in interest if paid over 30 years—that's more than the original loan amount!</p>

                                    <h3>1. Make Extra Monthly Payments</h3>
                                    <p class="text-xs">This is the simplest and most common strategy. By adding even a small, consistent amount to your regular payment, you can make a huge impact. To find out how extra payments shorten your payoff time, use our <a href="../calculators/extra-payment-calculator.html" class="font-semibold text-accent hover:underline">Extra Payment Calculator</a>.</p>

                                    <h3>2. Switch to Biweekly Payments</h3>
                                    <p class="text-xs">With a biweekly plan, you pay half of your monthly mortgage payment every two weeks. Because there are 26 two-week periods in a year, you end up making 13 full monthly payments instead of 12. That one extra payment goes directly to your principal and can shorten your loan term by several years.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    <h3>3. Refinance to a Shorter-Term Loan</h3>
                                    <p class="text-xs">If your financial situation has improved, consider refinancing from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage. Your monthly payments will be higher, but you'll get a lower interest rate and pay off the loan in half the time. <a href="../#refinance-tab" class="font-semibold text-accent hover:underline">Compare how refinancing could lower your term</a> with our dedicated calculator.</p>

                                    <h3>4. Apply Windfalls or Bonuses Toward the Principal</h3>
                                    <p class="text-xs">Whenever you receive a financial windfall—like a tax refund, a work bonus, or an inheritance—resist the urge to spend it all. Applying a lump sum directly to your principal can instantly shave months or even years off your loan. Be sure to instruct your lender to apply it to "principal only."</p>
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    <h3>5. Cut Expenses and Reinvest the Savings</h3>
                                    <p class="text-xs">Take a close look at your budget. Can you cut back on subscriptions, dining out, or other non-essential expenses? Redirecting even $50-$100 per month from your budget to your mortgage principal adds up significantly over time.</p>

                                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 mt-1">In many cases, yes. It provides a guaranteed 'return' on your money equal to your mortgage interest rate and offers significant peace of mind. However, if you have higher-interest debt (like credit cards) or believe you can earn a much higher return by investing, it might be better to put your extra cash there.</p>

                                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 mt-1">Yes, an 'accelerated' biweekly plan saves a significant amount of money. By paying half your monthly payment every two weeks, you end up making 13 full payments a year instead of 12. That extra payment goes directly to the principal, which can shave years off your loan and reduce total interest.</p>

                                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 mt-1">Absolutely. Applying a lump sum from a bonus, tax refund, or inheritance directly to your principal is one of the most effective ways to reduce your loan balance and future interest payments. Just be sure to specify that the payment is for 'principal only'.</p>
