                            <p>The first step to smart budgeting is understanding the concept of <strong>PITI</strong>: Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance. While your mortgage payment (Principal & Interest) is the largest piece, the other two can add hundreds of dollars to your monthly bill. Let’s break down each element so you can plan wisely.</p>
                            <p>→ First, you need a baseline. You can <a href="https://mortgageplanner.toolblaster.com/all-in-one-mortgage-planner.html#mortgage-tab" class="font-semibold text-accent hover:underline">estimate your base monthly payment here</a>.</p>

                            <p>This is the most straightforward cost. It's the amount you pay back to the lender each month, and it's made up of two parts:</p>
