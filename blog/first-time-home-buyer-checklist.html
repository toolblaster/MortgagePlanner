Aiming for a score above 740 will typically get you the best possible interest rates, saving you a lot of money.</p>

FHA loans can be as low as 3.5% down, and some conventional loans for first-time buyers are 3% down. VA and USDA loans can even be 0% down if you qualify. However, a larger down payment reduces your monthly payment and helps you avoid Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).</p>

A 30-year mortgage has lower, more manageable payments, freeing up cash for other investments or expenses. It depends on your monthly budget and long-term financial goals.</p>
