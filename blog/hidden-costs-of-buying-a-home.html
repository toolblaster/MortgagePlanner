                                            <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Generally, no. In most transactions in the US and Canada, the seller pays the commission for both their agent and the buyer's agent from the proceeds of the sale. While this cost is factored into the home's price, it's not an out-of-pocket expense you need to budget for at closing.</p>

Fees charged directly by the lender (like origination or application fees) may be negotiable. Third-party costs (like appraisal and title insurance) are less flexible, but you can shop around for different providers. You can also ask the seller to contribute to closing costs as part of your offer.</p>
