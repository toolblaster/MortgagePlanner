                        <h3 class="text-base font-bold text-gray-800">The Power of Extra Principal Payments</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 text-xs">Every mortgage payment you make is split between principal (the amount you borrowed) and interest (the cost of borrowing). In the early years of your loan, a large portion goes to interest. When you <strong>add an extra payment</strong> and direct it toward the principal, you reduce the loan balance itself. This means that in the following months, the interest is calculated on a smaller amount, creating a snowball effect of savings. Using a <strong>pay off mortgage faster calculator</strong> like the one on this page visualizes this powerful concept in real-time.</p>

                                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-xs">A standard bi-weekly plan takes your total annual payment, divides it by 26, and pays that amount every two weeks, resulting in 12 full payments a year. An 'accelerated' bi-weekly plan takes your standard monthly payment, divides it by two, and pays that half-amount every two weeks. Because there are 26 two-week periods in a year, this results in 13 full monthly payments, with the extra payment going directly to principal, thus accelerating your payoff.</p>
